We hope this data can be useful for you, have fun!

- id: id of each subject displayed in the experiment
- ra: Right ascension of the original cutout, (in the case of simulations as they are made using real images this correspond to the coordinates of the original image)
- dec: Declination of the original cutout, (in the case of simulations as they are made using real images this correspond to the coordinates of the original image)
- subject_name: id of each subject
- class: data set to which the subjects belongs
- value: classification given by the user
- user_name: The identity of the classifiers is protected, for this reason we replace their name for "userN"
- years: years of expertise in the field of gravitational lensing
- status: Academic status at the date the experiment was performed
- confidence: how confident the user feels doing this task (question answered before performing the experiment)
